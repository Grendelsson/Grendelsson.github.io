# Grendelsson.github.io

Test site for experimenting, mainly with Javascript and GTM/GA setup

## Things to learn about:
- API access to GA
  - Some progress made, still not hugely confident
- 0AUTH security - relevant to API access if used for work
  - Need to better understand how tokens are kept 'safe' etc.
- Unit testing
  - GTM apparently now has facility for building unit tests into tag templates
  - What exactly *is* a unit test?
